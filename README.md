This repository is to create content pages for websites linked to [Renewable Reindeer](http://www.nina.no/english/Research/Projects/Renewable-Reindeer "go to page"), co-existence toppforsk and traffic SIS.

## The repository contains:
### portals
**Definition** A portal is a page that provides an umbrella for a set of content pages based on a theme. Ideally (in my mind), the content on these portals should be kept limited. I guess we can see them fulfilling the same role as the introduction in a phd-thesis in Norway, they tie the different articles (here: content pages) together into one thematic story.
**Examples**
* Hj√∏rtevilt
* Co-existence
* [Landscape planning](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NINAnor/connectdeer/blob/master/landscape_planning.html)

### content pages
**Definition**  A content page provides the more detailed content on a topic. Ideally (in my mind), it should be general enough to be usable for different portals. Hence, limiting the need for duplicated efforts.
**Examples**
* Reindeer habitat selection
* Moose-Vehicle collissions
* Moose harvest strategies
* [Habitat functionality](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com//NINAnor/connectdeer/blob/master/habitat_functionality.html)

## Hints:
md-files are writen in markdown (such as this README.md), [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
html-files are writen in html, which is the standard for webpages, [html cheatsheet](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php)

By adding "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?" in front of a github html document (see examples above), you can render them automatically in the browser. One note, you may have to wait a few minutes for changes to take effect (I guess it has to do with synchronizing to the server)
